# vim-conf
My vim config for both vim and Gvim (Linux).

##Colors
molokai.vim: good colorshceme in terminal and GUI.

##Plugins 

###pyflakes
Python grammar checker.  
Make sure your vimrc has `filetype plugin indent on` so that pyflake-vim's ftplugin files are loaded automatically when you open a Python buffer.

### NERD Commenter
Quick comment.  
Using "," as mapleader (`let mapleader = ","` in .vimrc)

###auto-pairs
Complete "", [], () and so on.

##Syntax
python.vim: better python syntax support

#Note
.vimrc has proved to work well.  
.gvimrc need more test and improvement.
